Part 3 Submission — Java Script Styling Added Date Completed: 14 November 2025

Time Taken: Approximately 8 days

Summary

I finished adding JavaScript to the Spar Supermarket website after implementing all planned interactive features. 
The task took approximately 8 days to complete, including testing and debugging across all pages. The JavaScript additions included a typing animation on the homepage banner, a lightbox effect for images on the About and Services pages, and form validation on the Contact and Enquiry pages to ensure proper phone number and message input. I also added a gallery filter on the Services page that lets users sort images by category, and a dark mode toggle that allows visitors to switch between light and dark themes, with their preference saved for future visits. Together, these enhancements made the site more dynamic, user-friendly, and professional.
