This Spar Supermarket website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enhanced it with several interactive features to make it stand out.
I corrected all script links and cleaned up the HTML structure for consistency across pages, then styled the site with a modern design that includes button glow effects, rounded images, and a responsive layout for mobile devices.
On the homepage, I added a typing animation banner, while the About and Services pages now have a lightbox effect that lets users click images to view them in fullscreen.
The Services page also includes a gallery filter so visitors can sort images by category. Both the Contact and Enquiry forms were upgraded with JavaScript validation to check phone numbers and message length, ensuring proper input before submission.
On the Contact page, I embedded a real Google Map showing the Spar KwaMagxaki location in Port Elizabeth.
Finally, I implemented a dark mode toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with their preference saved for future visits.
Together, these improvements make the site more professional, interactive, and user-friendly, showcasing both design and coding skills.
